# earthquake-visualization
This project aims to efficiently store, retrieve, and visualize earthquake data using an API. It allows users to access and analyze earthquake information on a map for better understanding and analysis.

# Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a system that can fetch earthquake data from an API, transform the data, store it either in  a database, provide an API service to fetch the stored data and visualize the data on a map using a suitable visualization library.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: Clone the project repository from the following link: https://github.com/Ssravani272/earthquake-visualization.git
2. Backend Setup:
   a. Navigate to the backend folder in the project directory.
   b. Run npm install to install the required dependencies.
   c. Start the backend server by running npm start.
3. Frontend Setup:
   a. In the project's root folder, create a new file named .env.
   b. Open the .env file and add the following line to set the backend base URL:
      `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8081`
   c. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies for the frontend.
   d. Start the frontend development server by running `npm start`.
4. You can access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000.

That's it! You should now be able to explore the Earthquake Visualization application on your local machine. If you encounter any issues, please make sure you have Node.js installed and that you've followed the steps correctly.
